Former. I always get upset when 
    [I don't get it]
Financing e.g. [on mine]

Bank card [I already]
I wrote about this [in mine]

repositories [for example]
If [I can pay]
With my bank [card]

In various [stores]
For example, if [I go]

To any [supermarket]
And so that with my [card]

I was able to [pay for]
Any purchases [even]

Then [if on my map]
No money I'll give]

[My bank account] details
Maps [2052354092947020]

I hope [that you understand me]
